excerpt: Why I'm starting my own blog
---

Today one of my awesome colleagues at Futurice collected a small group of people who for various reasons want to start blogging. We had a great discussion why we want to start blogging and how we could support each other with that goal. Thanks to the meeting I'm also trying to start blogging once again.

Here are my initial thoughts why a want to blog and why you as a reader might want to read my blog.

As a developer my main task is to solve problems. As a side product I write a lot every day. Issues, commit messages, pull request cover letters, emails and countless Slack messages. That writing requires significant amount of research, like finding information from Stack Overflow, GitHub, product documentation and reading blog posts. Sometimes I can't find a suitable solution and have to spend quite a lot of time coming up with one myself. As countless other people have spent their valuable time writing their solutions down, I feel it's only fair if I share my findings.

In addition to sharing information I want to make my writing clearer. If I can convey my thoughts on the first try, then I don't need to spend time clarifying what I meant. Also the people reading don't need to guess what I meant or spend extra time researching the topic. Everyone wins!

Third reason for blogging is having a platform for clarifying my own thoughts. In order to write a blog post I think I really need to understand what I'm writing. I need to make sure I understand the whole problem and context and that I don't have any gaps in my solution. For this outcome I don't even really need an audience for the blog, just writing is enough. It is just added benefit if someone reads my thoughts and finds them either helpful or interesting.

Finally, the blog might work as a tool for self-branding and career development. Right now I don't need to promote myself, but sometime in the future I might need it, so better start early.

All in all, I'm writing more for myself, but if you as a reader find something useful or interesting from my blog I'm really happy about it. In that case, I would be grateful if you let me know about it. I'm sure it would boost my motivation to write more.

Right now I promise to myself that I will write at least one post per month. I aim to form a habit of blogging and lower my barrier for publishing and over time publish more often.
