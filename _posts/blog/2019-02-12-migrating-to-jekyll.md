title: Migrating to Jekyll
categories: general
---

My web page started to look really dated and I wanted to try something new so I migrated to Jekyll.

There's not much here right now, but I hopefully find the motivation to post something every now and then. At least it's now as easy as pushing a Markdown file to git.

I know that the default Jekyll theme (minima) is not very beautiful and that is something I would like to improve over time. I took a quick look to some other ready-made themes, but seems that they don't have that much features. Most probably I'll try to learn a little bit of web development and design again to get the features I want to one of the ready-made themes. We will see how that goes.
